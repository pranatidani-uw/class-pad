This code is a part of Balance Pad product I made during a hackathon in early January 2022. 
This represents the build of a transcript creator from videos or MP3s that are uploaded. The purpose of this is to help with students' productivity during class; 
many students are better readers than listeners, especially in a fast paced class, and such a transcript can help them learn better. 
This uses React JS, REST API, CSS, and HTML. I built my technical skills with this project by learning React for the first time and working heavily with APIs, and became a better
team player, learned to work smarter in time-constraining projects, and became more efficient with my code. 
It is just one part of the larger Balance Pad product we have. Balance Pad has many other platforms including to-do lists, mental health services, and more.
